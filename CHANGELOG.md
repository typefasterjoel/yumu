# 1.0.0

First initial version. This is the very basics. There are some known issues, that will be addressed in the later versions. This version allows you sign in to YouTube Music and enable Discord Prescence and change the audio output. This build has been tested in Mac OS and Windows.

## Known Issues

- **Mac OS** - Log in won't persist.
- **Mac OS** - Default close, minimize, and maximize buttons still show up
- **Both** - At random times the audio will switch back to the default audio output. This is very RARE.
